# Documentation Index

Welcome to the **SRG Interactive Audio-Guided Report** documentation. This folder contains the architectural blueprints, design guidelines, and pedagogical frameworks for building interactive audio stories.

## Core Documentation

*   **[README.md](./README.md)**: Main entry point for the project, covering quick start, installation, and basic usage.
*   **[architecture.md](./architecture.md)**: Technical overview of the Director/Actor pattern, data flow, and the Interaction Engine's orchestration logic.
*   **[design-system.md](./design-system.md)**: Defines the visual language, color palette, and the specific "Spotlight" mechanism used to highlight content.
*   **[focusregion-system.md](./focusregion-system.md)**: Explains the hierarchical ID system and manifest generation used to enable the audio-guided scrolling.
*   **[guide-adding-new-pages.md](./guide-adding-new-pages.md)**: Step-by-step workflow for developers to register new report pages and route them correctly.
*   **[guide-creating-audioguides.md](./guide-creating-audioguides.md)**: A manual for content creators on how to structure React pages and JSON timelines for audio synchronization.
*   **[guide-interactions.md](./guide-interactions.md)**: Documentation for the interaction types (polls, quizzes) and the technical difference between in-app modals and external embeds.
*   **[guide-pedagogies.md](./guide-pedagogies.md)**: Conceptual guide on the dialogic model, interaction taxonomy, and the pre/post evaluation pattern.
*   **[product-goals.md](./product-goals.md)**: High-level vision, core user stories, and success metrics for the project.
*   **[project-interactive.md](./project-interactive.md)**: original architectural brief describing the pivot to a native interaction engine with Firebase.
*   **[rules.md](./rules.md)**: The "Project Constitution" defining strict constraints like Swiss orthography (no 'ß') and routing standards.
*   **[tech-stach.md](./tech-stach.md)**: Listing of core frameworks (React, Vite), libraries, and infrastructure constraints.
*   **[claude.md](./claude.md)**: System prompt and context for AI assistants working on this repository.

## Configuration

*   **[settings.json](./settings.json)**: Global settings for the documentation or project environment.
*   **[settings.local.json](./settings.local.json)**: Local overrides for development environments.
